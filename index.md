Alevtina Verbovetskaya is the University Director of Library Systems in the [Office of Library Services](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/library-services/) at [The City University of New York](https://www.cuny.edu/). In this role, Allie is responsible for all aspects of library information systems as deployed or planned at the 31 CUNY Libraries supporting the University's 25 campuses and 100+ research centers and institutes. Most recently, she led the University-wide implementation of a new library services platform, Ex Libris Alma, that replaced the outdated integrated library system, Ex Libris Aleph, that was in use at the CUNY Libraries for almost 20 years.

Previously, Allie was the University Web & Mobile Systems Librarian in the CUNY Office of Library Services for more than seven years, where she led the successful implementation of the CUNY Libraries' discovery tool, [OneSearch](https://cuny-al.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01CUNY_AL:CUNY_AL) (based on Ex Libris's Primo), before taking over maintenance of it on behalf of the libraries. She also managed the web interface of the University-wide Aleph OPAC, including the development of its mobile interface as well as auxiliary features, such as texting holding information to patrons. She created a library systems status page, developed a library access privilege app, and instated patron error reporting tools in the CUNY Libraries' systems.

Allie has a unique mix of library training coupled with technical know-how. She studied Computer & Information Science at [Brooklyn College](https://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/) before going on to obtain her Masterâ€™s degree in Library & Information Science from [Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey](https://www.rutgers.edu/). As such, she is adept at bridging the technical and library aspects of projects, including the communication gap between technical jargon and librarian lingo.

She's mom to a rambunctious son who makes her laugh, and partner to an amazing guy who brews her sour beer.
