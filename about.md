I've spent my entire career in CUNY libraries, starting as an intern and working through reference, instruction, e-resources, technical services, and web services across multiple campuses before moving into systems. That path is a big part of how I think about this work now.

Today I lead a small team of systems librarians responsible for the platforms, discovery systems, and shared tools that keep CUNY's 31 academic libraries connected across 26 campuses. We led the university-wide migration from Aleph to Alma, and more recently we've been focused on building shared technical capacity—through open-source tooling, cross-campus knowledge sharing, and initiatives like an AI literacy cohort for CUNY librarians.

When I'm not thinking about library systems, I'm usually knitting, riding my bike, or cooking something vegan. I keep saying I'm going to get back into weightlifting.
