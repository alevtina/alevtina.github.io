I've spent my entire career in CUNY libraries—starting as an intern and working my way through just about every role you can hold in an academic library: e-resources, technical services, instructional design, reference, instruction. That path through different campuses and different kinds of work is a big part of how I think about systems now. Today I lead a small team of systems librarians responsible for the technology that runs across CUNY's 31 academic libraries—library services platforms, discovery layers, proxy servers, and a growing portfolio of shared tools—plus the support, training, and coordination that keep everything working across 26 campuses.

Most people call me Allie. When I'm not thinking about library systems, I'm usually knitting, riding my bike, or cooking something vegan. I keep saying I'm going to get back into weightlifting.
