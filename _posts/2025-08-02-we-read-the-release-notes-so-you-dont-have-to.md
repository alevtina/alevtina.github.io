_One year into Shelf Help, here’s what we’ve learned about making library systems feel less like a black box._

For a long time, we read the release notes the way many people do: haphazardly, hurriedly, and mostly in preparation for a committee meeting.

We'd skim through the Alma and Primo VE quarterly updates—sometimes individually, sometimes together—then talk through the highlights four separate times: once with each of our three working groups and again with our advisory committee. It was theoretical (“This probably affects cataloging…”), abstract (“Based on the screenshot, I think it works like this…”), and ultimately redundant.

And the kicker? Most of that insight never made it past the committee rep.

It wasn’t engaging, it wasn’t efficient, and it wasn’t helping anyone actually understand the changes coming their way. So in late 2024, we decided to rethink it.

## Enter: Shelf Help

My team at the CUNY Office of Library Services sat down and asked ourselves a simple question:

> What would it look like to actually support our librarians during release cycles—not just inform them?
The answer became _Shelf Help_, a quarterly open webinar that walks library staff through what’s new in Alma and Primo VE. We time each session to land the Thursday before Ex Libris pushes changes to production, giving people time to understand what’s coming and ask questions before it affects their work.

We held our first session in November 2024. One year and four sessions later, it’s become a reliable touchstone in our systems calendar—with around 70 registrants and 80% attendance each time.

# Why It Works (And What We Do Differently)

_Shelf Help_ isn't just a reading of the release notes. It's a systems-thinking exercise with a service mindset.

We:
* Read and analyze all the release notes
* Test each feature in our Alma/Primo VE sandboxes
* Focus on what's real and what’s relevant to our campuses
* Build clear examples, annotated slides, and walkthroughs
* Share recordings and documentation for asynchronous access
* Create a space where anyone—regardless of committee role—can learn and ask questions

Instead of parsing dense documents in committee silos, we'e created a shared, cross-campus conversation.

## The Philosophy Behind It

"We read the release notes so you don't have to" isn't just a tagline. It's a commitment.

It's a commitment to:

* **Transparency**: Explaining not just what is changing, but why it matters
* **Equity**: Giving everyone—regardless of job title—access to the same timely, clear information
* **Collaboration**: Helping campuses stay aligned, informed, and confident about what’s coming
* **Trust**: Showing that our central team is engaged, responsive, and invested in easing the burden

It's also an acknowledgment that our work as systems leaders isn't just technical—it's deeply human. Every configuration setting we adjust affects real people doing real work. Every overlooked release detail can become someone's emergency.

## One Year In: What I've Learned

_Shelf Help_ has taught me that support doesn't always mean creating something brand-new. Sometimes, it means reframing what already exists—like release notes—and making them legible, actionable, and collaborative.

It's also reminded me that systems work, when done well, can help people feel less alone. In a massive university system like CUNY, a little clarity goes a long way.

## What's Next

We'll keep iterating. We'll keep inviting feedback. We'll keep showing up every quarter with tested features, sandbox insights, and a few nerdy jokes hidden in the slides.

Because reading the release notes is just the start. Helping people understand them—and feel confident navigating what comes next—that's the real work.
