At the end of my ENG 110 (Critical Thinking) classes, I ask the students to fill out a survey. One of the questions is "What would make this workshop better? Why?" The best response I've received so far:

> _more videos because they seem to catch my attention._

Straight from the horse's mouth! Students seem to be interested in the video clips I show them. (Simpsons FTW!)

The least useful response I've received to that question has been:

> _More fun activities._

That's a totally legitimate request â€” I just wish he/she gave an example or two of these coveted "fun activities"!
